# Cybersource Link Cartridge

This is a repository for the Cybersource SFCC Storefront Reference Architecture reference application integration cartridge.

THe Cybersource cartridge has a link cartridge (`int_cybersource_sfra`) provided by Cybersource that is never directly customized or edited. Instead, customization cartridges are layered on top of the base cartridge and this link cartridge. This change is intended to allow for easier adoption of new features and bug fixes.

# Getting Started

1 Set node version to 8.11.3

2 Clone this repository.

3 Run `npm install` to install all of the local dependencies (node version 8.x or current LTS release recommended)

4 Run `npm run compile:js` from the command line that would compile all client-side JS files. Run `npm run compile:scss` and `npm run compile:fonts` that would do the same for css and fonts.

5 Create `dw.json` file in the root of the project:
```json
{
    "hostname": "your-sandbox-hostname.demandware.net",
    "username": "yourlogin",
    "password": "yourpwd",
    "code-version": "version_to_upload_to"
}
```

6 Run `npm run uploadCartridge` command that would upload `int_cybersource_sfra` cartridge to the sandbox you specified in dw.json file.

7 Add the `int_cybersource_sfra` cartridge to your cartridge path.

8 You should now be ready to navigate to and use your site.


# NPM scripts

## Compiling your application

* `npm run compile:scss` - Compiles all .scss files into CSS.
* `npm run compile:js` - Compiles all .js files and aggregates them.

## Linting your code

`npm run lint` - Execute linting for all JavaScript and SCSS files in the project. You should run this command before committing your code.

## Watching for changes and uploading
